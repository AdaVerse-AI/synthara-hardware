# Synthara Breast Cancer Detection AI
---


## Overview

Synthara Breast Cancer Detection AI is a  learning-based solution built to assist with the early detection of breast cancer using medical image data (e.g. mammograms or histopathology images). Designed with Synthara's efficiency principles in mind, the system leverages a modular, hardware-aware architecture to enable deployment. It till be used in tandem with a sports bra-type sensory device to try and identify abnormalities in the breast during usage.


## Purpose
The Synthara Breast Cancer Detection AI identifies abnormalities in the breast during usage to combat breast cancer at it's early stages.
